# php-dice
A generic RPG dice roller syntax and library.

## Getting started

php-dice is designed to work out of the box. It means that installation requires minimal steps.

### Download

php-dice can be installed using composer. Run following command to download and
install php-dice:

```bash
composer require "fr-esco/php-dice"
```

### Usage

As shown in `index.php`, once required the library, you can instantiate the parser:

```php
$parser = new dice\Parser;
```

Then, you can parse your expression:

```php
$result = $parser->parse($expression);
```

Later in your code, you can evaluate the parsed result, where the returned object can be
inspected for debugging purposes:

```php
$result->evaluate();
```

Finally, you can print out either a raw string representation of the parsed expression
or its beautified version by running respectively:

```php
echo $result;
# or
echo $result->render();
```

The final value is stored in its `value` property.

```php
$result->value;
```

### Customization

You can also optionally provide a custom *scope* with additional functions or variables that should be evaluated
to the parser:

```php
$parser = new dice\Parser([
    'prop' => 'test',
    'foo' => 1
    'doubleUp' => function($expr, $scope) {
        $expr = $expr->evaluate($scope);
        return $expr->value * 2;
    }
]);
```

## Development

### Technology Stack
The grammar is built with [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/).
Its PHP version is generated by [php-pegjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/php-pegjs).

### Customization
If you need to customize the `grammar/dice.pegphp`, you can regenerate `src/Parser` via Javascript:

```bash
# Install node modules
npm install

# Build dice\Parser for PHP
npm run build
```

### Visual Test
Serve `index.php` with your favourite webserver and browse to `http://localhost/php-dice/index.php`.

You can enter the expression to parse in the textbox and submit the form by clicking on the button.

Details and results will be shown below.
